                <p>PhD Student in Security</p>
                <p>University of Colorado Colorado Springs, USA</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify;">I am a dedicated researcher, academic, and software engineer with a strong background in computer science, cybersecurity, and machine learning. Hailing from Munshigonj, Bangladesh, I am currently pursuing a PhD in Security at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs, USA. My research focuses on advanced topics such as anomaly detection in 5G/6G networks using Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and anonymous networking detection in cryptocurrency. My research interests span machine learning, deep learning, cybersecurity, graphical authentication, and network security.</br>

I began my academic journey with a Bachelor of Science in Information and Communication Technology from The Millennium University, Bangladesh, where I graduated with a CGPA of 3.66/4.0. My passion for research was evident early on, with my undergraduate thesis focused on designing a network security system using IP tables. I then went on to complete a Master’s by Research in Computer Science at the University of Malaya, Malaysia, where my thesis revolved around preventing shoulder-surfing attacks using a novel graphical authentication technique.</br></br>

Throughout my academic career, I have gained substantial experience in both research and teaching. I served as a Graduate Research Assistant at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs, where I worked on projects involving anomaly detection and cybersecurity. Before that, I held a Research Assistant position at the University of Malaya, contributing to studies on tools for identifying emotions and personality traits, as well as graphical authentication techniques.</br></br>

In addition to my research endeavors, I have extensive experience as a lecturer, having taught courses in Information and Communication Technology at multiple institutions in Bangladesh, including Serajabad Rana Shafiullah College, Yunus Khan Memorial College, and Basudia Nesaria Islamia College. My teaching repertoire covers a wide range of topics, from digital logic and computer networks to web programming and database management.</br></br>

I have published several peer-reviewed journal articles and conference papers, including works on graphical password techniques, the impact of 4IR technology, and phishing susceptibility. My research has appeared in reputable journals like Frontiers of Computer Science and Security Journal. I have also authored three books focusing on information technology in financial services and e-banking.</br></br>

My technical expertise spans various programming languages and technologies, including C, C++, Java, Python, PHP, and JavaScript. I am also skilled in network administration and hold certifications like Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) and Linux System Administration.</br></br>

My professional activities include serving as an invited reviewer for several journals and being actively involved in community service through memberships in organizations like the Engineering Students Association of Bangladesh (ESAB) and Quantum Foundation Bangladesh. My contributions to academia and industry reflect my commitment to advancing technology and education.</br></br>

In my journey, I have been recognized with numerous awards and honors, including a Graduate Research Assistantship at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs and a Merit Scholarship during my undergraduate studies. My strong academic foundation, coupled with my passion for research and teaching, positions me as a promising figure in the fields of cybersecurity and machine learning.</br></br>
