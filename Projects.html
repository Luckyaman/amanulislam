I am a dedicated researcher, academic, and software engineer with a strong background in computer science, cybersecurity, and machine learning. Hailing from Munshigonj, Bangladesh, I am currently pursuing a <strong>PhD in Security at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs, USA</strong>. My research focuses on advanced topics such as anomaly detection in 5G/6G networks using Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and anonymous networking detection in cryptocurrency. My research interests span machine learning, deep learning, cybersecurity, graphical authentication, and network security.</br></br>

I have published several peer-reviewed journal articles and conference papers, including works on graphical password techniques, the impact of 4IR technology, and phishing susceptibility.<strong> My research has appeared in reputable journals like Frontiers of Computer Science and Security Journal</strong>. I have also authored three books focusing on information technology in financial services and e-banking.</br></br>
