Throughout my academic career, I have gained substantial experience in both research and teaching. I served as a <strong>Graduate Research Assistant at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs</strong>, where I worked on projects involving anomaly detection and cybersecurity. Before that, I held a Research Assistant position at the University of Malaya, contributing to studies on tools for identifying emotions and personality traits, as well as graphical authentication techniques.</br></br>

In addition to my research endeavors, I have extensive experience as a lecturer, having taught courses in Information and Communication Technology at multiple institutions in Bangladesh, including <strong>Serajabad Rana Shafiullah College, Yunus Khan Memorial College, and Basudia Nesaria Islamia College</strong>. My teaching repertoire covers a wide range of topics, from digital logic and computer networks to web programming and database management.</br></br>
